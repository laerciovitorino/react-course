Setup

1 - If you haven't node installed in your machine yet, go to https://nodejs.org,
    download it and then install it on your machine.

    To check out if everything is okay, open the terminal(Git Bash - Windows(suggested)),
    and then type in node -v. If the version you downloaded appears on the screen,
    you are good to go!

2 - Then, check which version of npm to you have installed. To do that, just
    type in npm -v. As the same with node -v, a version number should appears on
    the screen.
